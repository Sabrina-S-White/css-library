# css-library

I'm storing useful css references in this repo. 

library.css, pseudo.css, and selector.txt are reference pages that describe what styling options do. normal.css is a basic reset document to copy in to get started. it's primarily taken from normalize.css (https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) with some changes to fit my needs more. One exmaple of this is changing instances of 'em' to 'rem' to avoid cascading font size inconsistencies.

feel free to take anything from these documents. they are open references!
