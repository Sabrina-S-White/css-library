/* Variables and Properties in css */
/* You want to use variables because then you can set something, like a color pallete, once. When it's set you can then reference it multiple times in your document, tweaking the initial declaration if you want to tweak a color instead of every instance of that declaration. */
/* Variables are not universal if you don't put them in :root. This means that you can declare variables in a div that will only be usable by child elements. */

:root {
    /* Use this space to declare variables. */
    --background-color-main: aliceblue;
    --main-border: 2px solid black;
    --border: 2px solid blue;
}

main {
    background-color: var(--background-color-main);
    border: var(--main-border);
    /* You can later call variables using the var() function. */
}

/* var() takes two inputs, the main declaration and a fallback value. This can be its own variable with its own fallback value */

main {
    background-color: var(--background-color-main, white);
    border: var(--main-border, var(--border, green));
